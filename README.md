# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository implements a machine learning model for detecting fake news from news articles. The goal is to build a system that can classify whether a given news article is true or fake, based on text features such as content, headline, and language patterns.

## About

Fake news is a growing concern, especially on social media and news websites. This project focuses on detecting fake news by using machine learning techniques to analyze text data. The system takes an article as input and classifies it into two categories: *real* or *fake*.

### Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- `pip` or `conda` for package management

You can use the following libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk`
- `tensorflow` (if using deep learning models)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Preprocess Data
The first step is data preprocessing, which involves:
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization or stemming
- Vectorization using methods like TF-IDF or Word2Vec

To preprocess the data, run:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 2. Train the Model
To train the model using different machine learning algorithms, run:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script will:
- Load the dataset
- Train models using different algorithms
- Save the trained models to disk

### 3. Make Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new data (news articles) using:

```bash
python predict.py --article "Your news article text here"
```

This will output whether the article is classified as *real* or *fake*.

## Model Architecture

In this project, we use multiple machine learning algorithms to classify the news:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and the best-performing model is chosen for predictions.

Additionally, we perform text vectorization using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** for feature extraction.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's [Fake News Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data), which consists of news articles labeled as "real" or "fake".

Ensure that the data is placed in the `data/` folder before running the scripts.

### Dataset Structure:
```
data/
  |- train.csv
  |- test.csv
  |- labels.csv
```

## Results

After training the models, the performance can be evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified articles.
- **Precision**: The ability of the classifier to correctly identify fake news.
- **Recall**: The ability of the classifier to detect all fake news.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Model performance is saved and can be viewed by running:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```
